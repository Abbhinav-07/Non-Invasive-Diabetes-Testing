## Problem Statement

Traditional glucose monitoring systems rely on invasive finger-prick tests, which are:
- Painful and uncomfortable for regular use
- Expensive due to consumables (test strips, lancets)
- Risky in terms of infection and cross-contamination
- Time-consuming and not user-friendly

## Proposed Solution

The system utilizes **Raspberry Pi hardware** and **CNN models** to perform real-time glucose level classification based on image analysis.

### Modules

1. **Image Capturing Module**  
   - A **Raspberry Pi Camera** captures high-resolution images of the fingertip under **675 nm laser illumination**.

2. **Feature Extraction Module**  
   - The **Raspberry Pi Zero** processes images to extract features such as intensity variation and light absorption patterns.

3. **Prediction Module**  
   - A **trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** predicts blood glucose concentration from the extracted features.
